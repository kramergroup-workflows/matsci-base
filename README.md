# matsci-base

Base Dockerimage for python workflow steps using pymatgen, pandas, numpy, etc.

This docker image is meant as a base image for workflow containers utilising popular python libraries. These are very convinient, but 
unfortunately rather large. So a common stack of base layers will hopefully keep disk pressure low.
